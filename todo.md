## to do

1. loop through quotes on main page, sort by ranking
2. random quote feature
3. search functionality
4. ranking on author page (change functionality to plus/minus)
5. code crud
6. unit tests
7. modularize (`utility.js` for helper functions)
8. web sql instead of local storage?
9. minimize side affects (pure functions)
10. replace concatenation with string formatting (`.suplant`)
11. data modeling - perhaps an array of objects: [{author,quote,total}]
